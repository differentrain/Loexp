Open source command-line version of [localc](https://github.com/differentrain/LocalcDocuments). 

## About

I ported the expression parser of [localc](https://github.com/differentrain/LocalcDocuments) whose language version is C# 7.3  to C# 11, so **.NET 7 SDK is required to build or run this program.** 

The abstraction of  C# 11 is so beautiful, I try out generic-math, static-members-in-interfaces,  and so on, these features are very interesting.

Because this is only a simple attempt, none of codes are verified, so I'm pessimistic about the performance of these code, although it looks good.

On the contrary, the expansibility of program is improved. It's very easy to add new operators, new functions, and new constants to this program with afew lines of code.
